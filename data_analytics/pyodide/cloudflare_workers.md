Cloudflare is an edge-cloud service provider that is supported by a serverless framework. Cloudflare Workers can modify and respond to HTTP requests whilst aiding in lessening the latency and increasing application performance. Serverless computing is readily becoming one of the most talked-about technologies when it comes to cloud or edge website or applications. Due to being secure, scalable, and budget-friendly, serverless computing is used by many cloud-edge service providers to make them stand out from the others.

## How Cloudflare workers work

Cloudflare Workers, a serverless function by Cloudflare, runs on an edge network and is written in JavaScript. When workers are deployed, the code written is distributed across all the edge locations offered by Cloudflare, with minimal latency. The Cloudflare Workers' runtime utilizes the V8 engine as they possess similar behavior to JavaScript in Node.js or a browser. Workers serve in executing lightweight JavaScript for augmentation of existing applications or in the creation of new ones.

Workers use **[Isolates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-workers-works)** instead of containers or virtual machines, allowing the V8 engine to run loads of application processes onto a single server securely and efficiently. Compared to virtual machines, the overhead required for code execution is considerably reduced, allowing instant execution and lesser memory consumption.

Cloudflare Workers prove to be beneficial in many sectors for applications in a serverless environment. Affordability, security, and automatic scaling are the key highlights when compared to other serverless platforms. With no pre-generated static assets, Workers powerful edge network can generate static assets seamlessly.

## Summary

Enterprises across the globe are relying on serverless computing as they look to enhance their application backend functionality and performance. Cloudflare Workers run on the fabric leveraging the globally distributed network of servers to run a code closest to the service users.
