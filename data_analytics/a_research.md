`Does anyone happen to know what causes this in excels that have a connection to a microsoft access database?

I can't update out TYE database due to this error, and it is a pretty critical excel for our product validation lab. I put in a ticket but haven't gotten any response on it more than it being assigned to someone in the last 18 hours.`

## **[Moxa’s Second-generation SoC](../research/m_z/moxa/architecture/SoC.md)**

The MiiNe was created to provide manufacturers with a competitive embedded serial-to-Ethernet solution. The MiiNePort E3, which uses the MiiNe for its SoC, is a compact embedded device server that has the lowest power consumption among similar products. The MiiNe has the following features:

- Designed for serial-to-Ethernet applications
- Uses an Arm core
- Uses Moxa’s own advanced UART technology
- 2 MB Flash and 4 MB SDRAM memory built in

Last Updated : 18 Jul, 2025
PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, designed for big data processing and analytics. It lets Python developers use Spark's powerful distributed computing to efficiently process large datasets across clusters. It is widely used in data analysis, machine learning and real-time processing.

## How much are we spending on each line

Work with Randy Albion controller.

## Task Management

Jira is a project management and issue-tracking tool used by teams, especially in software development, to plan, track, and manage their work. It helps teams organize projects, track bugs and issues, and streamline their workflows through customizable boards like Kanban and Scrum, allowing them to manage tasks and monitor progress from start to finish.

Many modern project management and development tools are designed to run in containerized environments:
GitLab: A popular option that combines project management, source code management, and CI/CD pipelines and offers extensive documentation for Kubernetes deployment.
Redmine / Jira: Self-hosted instances of these tools can be containerized and deployed on K8s, often with community-maintained Helm charts available.
