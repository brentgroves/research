Cpk data analysis assesses a process's ability to meet specifications by measuring both its centering and variability. A higher Cpk value indicates a more capable process, while a Cpk below \(1.0\) suggests the process is not capable and likely to produce defects. Analysis involves plotting the data, calculating the Cpk using the formula: \(Cpk=min(USL-\text{mean})/(3*\text{Stdev}),(\text{mean}-LSL)/(3*\text{Stdev})\), and interpreting the results to identify areas for improvement.
