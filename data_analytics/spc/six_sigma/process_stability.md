## What is Process Stability?

Any successful manufacturing or service operation lies in the concept of process stability.

It represents the capability of a process to perform consistently and predictably over time, producing outputs that meet specified requirements.

## Understanding Process Stability

Process stability refers to the state where a process exhibits only **[common cause variations](https://www.6sigma.us/cause-variation/what-is-common-cause-variation/)**, which are inherent and expected fluctuations within the system.

These variations are typically small and occur randomly, resulting in a consistent and predictable output distribution.

When a process is stable, it operates within defined control limits, and its performance remains reliable and consistent over time.
