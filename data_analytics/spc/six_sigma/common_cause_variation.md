# **[Understanding, Analyzing, and Controlling Common Cause Variation](https://www.6sigma.us/cause-variation/what-is-common-cause-variation/)**

The pursuit of consistency is fundamental to operational success, yet variability seems unavoidable due to the nature of people, processes, and work environments.

While random fluctuations are expected in any system, too much variability negatively impacts an organization’s quality, productivity, and ability to meet customer demands.

Understanding common cause variation and implementing strategies to monitor and minimize its effects is therefore critical for organizations seeking continuous improvement.

Common cause variation refers to random, natural variation inherent in stable processes. Unlike fluctuations from unstable processes or changes in inputs, common cause variation originates from factors within the system itself that interact randomly but predictably.

For example, common causes could include minor differences in environmental conditions, raw materials, or operator technique.

Equipped with methods to interpret process metrics and **[address root causes](https://www.6sigma.us/rca/root-cause-analysis-getting-to-the-root-of-the-problem/)**, professionals can transform obstacles into opportunities to better meet specifications.

In statistical process control (SPC), common cause variation manifests on **[control charts](https://www.6sigma.us/tag/control-chart/)** as random oscillation within the statistically calculated upper and lower control limits.
