Control charts are graphical plots used in production control to determine whether quality and manufacturing processes are being controlled under stable conditions. [ISO 7870-1](1) The hourly status is arranged on the graph, and the occurrence of abnormalities is judged based on the presence of data that differs from the conventional trend or deviates from the control limit line. Control charts are classified into Shewhart individuals control chart [ISO 7870-2](2) and CUSUM(CUsUM)(or cumulative sum control chart)(ISO 7870-4).[3]

Control charts, also known as Shewhart charts (after Walter A. Shewhart) or process-behavior charts, are a statistical process control tool used to determine if a manufacturing or business process is in a state of control. It is more appropriate to say that the control charts are the graphical device for statistical process monitoring (SPM). Traditional control charts are mostly designed to monitor process parameters when the underlying form of the process distributions are known. However, more advanced techniques are available in the 21st century where incoming data streaming can-be monitored even without any knowledge of the underlying process distributions. **[Distribution-free control charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution-free_control_chart)** are becoming increasingly popular.[citation needed]

## Distribution-free control charts

Distribution-free (nonparametric) control charts are one of the most important tools of statistical process monitoring and control. Implementation techniques of distribution-free control charts do not require any knowledge about the underlying process distribution or its parameters. The main advantage of distribution-free control charts is its in-control robustness, in the sense that, irrespective of the nature of the underlying process distributions, the properties of these control charts remain the same when the process is smoothly operating without presence of any assignable cause.

Early research on nonparametric control charts may be found in 1981[1] when P.K. Bhattacharya and D. Frierson introduced a nonparametric control chart for detecting small disorders. However, major growth of nonparametric control charting schemes has taken place only in the recent years.[when?]
