Hi Team,
Hope you are all doing well. While looking for a statistics book in line with what we do I found this and wanted to pass it along. Hope you enjoy it and please share anything you have found.

thanks,
Brent

"For without a thorough understanding of the basics, process
improvement is virtually impossible.
On the other hand, workers do not have to be statisticians to take
advantage of SPC. That is the reason for this book:  to provide a
practical, common-sense explanation of the underlying principles of
statistical process control. The topics included in this book have been
based on more than 25 years of exposure to the customer side of
quality assurance. Readers should not find the techniques and cal-
culations described in this publication intimidating. Today’s SPC
software programs were designed to plug in the correct formulas and
perform the number crunching for you so instead you can spend your
time effectively managing the process."
