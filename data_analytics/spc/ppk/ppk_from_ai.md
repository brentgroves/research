It would be great if the data and chart could show 30 day CPK and 90 day PPK.

A PPk in statistical process control measures the overall capability of a process, accounting for both its variation and how well it is centered between the specification limits. It is the minimum of two one-sided capability indices: \(P_{PU}\) (upper) and \(P_{PL}\) (lower).

Calculation and interpretation Formula:\(P_{PU}=\frac{(USL-\text{mean})}{3\sigma }\) (if the mean is closer to the Upper Specification Limit)\(P_{PL}=\frac{(\text{mean}-LSL)}{3\sigma }\) (if the mean is closer to the Lower Specification Limit)\(PPk=\min (P_{PU},P_{PL})\)
