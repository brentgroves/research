# **[Six Sigma PPM: Mastering Defect Reduction for Operational Excellence](https://www.6sigma.us/process-improvement/six-sigma-ppm-defect-reduction/)**

One of the core metrics in Six Sigma is Parts Per Million (PPM), which quantifies the defect rate or number of flawed units in a manufacturing or service process.

In its relentless pursuit of perfection, Six Sigma aims for a quality level where defects barely happen—no more than 3.4 **[defects per million chances (DPMO)](https://www.6sigma.us/process-improvement/six-sigma-defects-per-million/)**.

This intensely high benchmark also called the “Six Sigma level“, corresponds to an amazing 99.99966% defect-free rate. It sets a tremendous bar for process performance.

The PPM defective concept is straightforward yet profoundly impactful. It’s the expected number of flawed parts or instances out of one million opportunities.

By monitoring and minimizing PPM, businesses can boost customer satisfaction, cut waste, and continuously make processes better.
