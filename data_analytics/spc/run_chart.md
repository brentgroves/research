# **[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_chart)**

A run chart, also known as a run-sequence plot is a graph that displays observed data in a time sequence. Often, the data displayed represent some aspect of the output or performance of a manufacturing or other business process. It is therefore a form of line chart.

## Overview

Run sequence plots[1] are an easy way to graphically summarize a univariate data set. A common assumption of univariate data sets is that they behave like:[2]

- random drawings;
- from a fixed distribution;
- with a common location; and
- with a common scale.

A univariate data set contains observations for only one variable, or characteristic, such as the heights of students in a class or the salaries of workers in a company.

With run sequence plots, shifts in location and scale are typically quite evident. Also, outliers can easily be detected.

Run charts are analyzed to find anomalies in data that suggest shifts in a process over time or special factors that may be influencing the variability of a process. Typical factors considered include unusually long "runs" of data points above or below the average line, the total number of such runs in the data set, and unusually long series of consecutive increases or decreases.[1]

Run charts are similar in some regards to the **[control charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_chart)** used in statistical process control, but do not show the control limits of the process. They are therefore simpler to produce, but do not allow for the full range of analytic techniques supported by control charts.
