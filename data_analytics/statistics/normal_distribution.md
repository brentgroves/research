# **[Normal Distribution in Lean Six Sigma. Learn the Bell Curve](<https://www.6sigma.us/six-sigma-in-focus/normal-distribution-lean-six-sigma-bell-curve/>)**

Six Sigma is a quality management system that aims to decrease variance and errors in business processes.

The strategy makes use of statistical analysis and a data-driven methodology to reduce inefficiencies in the process and attain enduring outcomes.

A key concept in Six Sigma is the normal distribution or bell curve.

The bell curve helps Six Sigma practitioners link process metrics to customer requirements. It visually depicts how **[variation](https://www.6sigma.us/glossary_term/variation/)** affects process yield and capabilities.

By understanding specs and tolerances, processes can be optimized to deliver “perfect” output.

## Key Highlights of Six Sigma Bell Curve

- The Six Sigma methodology relies heavily on statistical analysis and normal distribution. Mastering the bell curve is critical for effective implementation, which is a key focus of Six Sigma certification programs.
- While the bell curve sets challenging benchmarks, its principles serve as catalysts to drive process innovation and improvement across the organization.
- The journey towards Six Sigma levels of performance is gradual. However, each small gain compounds over time to achieve quantum leaps in quality.
- With robust data-driven approaches for defect reduction and variation control, the bell curve enables fact-based decision-making.

## The Six Sigma approach

Achieving a defect level of 3.4 defects per million opportunities (DPMO) is the main objective of Six Sigma. Six Sigma programs use the five-phase improvement cycle of define, measure, analyze, improve, and control (**[DMAIC](https://www.6sigma.us/dmaic-process/)**) to strive toward this aim.

Statistical methods and a range of quality management instruments are employed at every stage to comprehend process capability and pinpoint the underlying causes of errors.

## Role of Normal Distribution / Six Sigma Bell Curve  

The normal distribution, also known as the Six Sigma bell curve or Gaussian distribution, is a fundamental concept in Six Sigma. It describes how process metrics like cycle times, temperatures, pressures, concentrations, etc. are distributed in a stable process.

The bell curve plots the occurrence of different values, with the center representing the average value. The width of the bell indicates the amount of variation.

So the bell curve visually depicts both process center and spread. By fitting data to normal distributions, Six Sigma helps predict how often defects could occur at the tails.

This guides goal-setting for significant defect reduction. Understanding variance through the bell curve allows for improving process capability over time.

## What is a Normal Distribution?

- Also called Gaussian distribution or bell curve
- A probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean
- Shows how data is distributed about the average
- Used to represent process performance data
- Helps determine process stability and capability

## Properties and characteristics

- Bell-shaped symmetric curve
- Mean, median, and mode coincide in the center of the curve
- Area under curve equals 1 representing 100% probability
- Exact shape defined by mean and standard deviation
- 68% of data falls within 1 standard deviation of mean
- 95% within 2 standard deviations
- 99.7% within 3 standard deviations

## Reason for bell shape

- **[Central limit theorem](https://www.6sigma.us/six-sigma-in-focus/central-limit-theorem/)** in statistics
- Means of random samples follow normal distribution
- Sample means cluster around the true population mean
- Variation in data leads to a bell curve shape
- The smaller the variation, the taller and skinner the bell  
- The larger the variation, the shorter and wider the bell
