# Platform Engineering

Platform engineering builds and maintains internal developer platforms (IDPs) and self-service tools that help software teams build, deploy, and run applications faster, more reliably, and securely, acting like an "internal product" to improve developer experience and efficiency by abstracting infrastructure complexity and providing "golden paths" for common workflows. It's a discipline rooted in DevOps, focused on creating standardized, automated systems (like CI/CD, environment provisioning, monitoring) so developers can focus on coding rather than infrastructure management.  
Core Concepts
Internal Developer Platform (IDP): A curated set of tools, services, and workflows delivered as a product for developers.
Self-Service: Developers can provision resources and manage pipelines independently through the IDP.
Golden Paths: Predefined, standardized, and secure workflows that guide developers towards best practices.
Product Mindset: Treating the platform as an internal product with developers as customers, ensuring usability and value.
Key Goals
Boost Developer Productivity: Reduce cognitive load and time spent on infrastructure.
Enhance Security & Compliance: Embed security controls and governance into the platform.
Improve Reliability & Consistency: Standardize environments and automate processes.
Optimize Costs: Efficient resource utilization through automation.
How it Differs from DevOps
DevOps: A culture and set of practices (collaboration, automation) for combining Dev & Ops.
Platform Engineering: Builds the tools and platforms that enable DevOps practices, creating the environment for smooth workflows.
Key Responsibilities of Platform Engineers
Designing and maintaining CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code (IaC), and observability tools.
Automating infrastructure provisioning and management.
Ensuring security, access control (RBAC), and compliance.
Collaborating with SREs, DevOps, and developers to integrate the platform.
