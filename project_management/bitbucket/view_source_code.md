Whether anyone can view your source file in Bitbucket using a URL depends entirely on the repository's privacy setting.
For Private Repositories
If your repository is private, only users who have been explicitly granted permission (with at least "Read" access) can view its contents, even if they have the direct URL to the file. Users without permission will be prompted to log in and will be unable to access the file.
For Public Repositories
If your repository is public, then anyone with the URL can access and view the source file without needing to log in or have a Bitbucket account. Public repositories are visible to everyone on the internet.
Summary
Private repo file URL: Requires authentication and specific permissions. Strangers cannot view it.
Public repo file URL: Anyone can view it.
You can check and change your repository's privacy setting in the Repository settings area. For instructions on how to manage this, refer to the Atlassian documentation on setting repository privacy options.
