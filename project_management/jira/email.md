Just started using Oracle's star review app in October and wasn't quite sure how to use it. For 2026 I decided to use **[Jira (AI-Powered Project Management)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPOWZSxEslU)** to manage the Oracle's Star review goals.

## **[OKRs: The ultimate guide to objectives and key results](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr)**

An OKR is a popular management strategy that defines objectives and tracks results. It helps create alignment and engagement around measurable goals.

Introduced and popularized in the 1970s at Intel, it has since spread throughout technology companies as a way to help employees understand and be engaged in an enterprise's charter. Studies show that team members are more engaged in their work and more productive when they have a clear idea of what the team is trying to achieve, and more importantly, the significance of the task.

## **[What are OKRs?](https://monday.com/blog/project-management/okr-for-project-management/#:~:text=What%20are%20OKRs?,individual%20workload%20and%20increase%20productivity)**

OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results. They’re a simple project management tool that help project managers outline and meet their goals. They typically work by prompting you to set an objective and then come up with three to five key results you’re hoping to see. The OKRs should help your team members analyze and understand what role they need to play in the project and which tasks to complete.

For example, say you’re running a project that focuses on improving overall customer satisfaction. One objective may be to improve your customer service department. Examples of key results might include:

- Bringing the average call waiting time under five minutes
- Cutting churn rate in half
- Hiring two new customer service representatives to reduce individual workload and increase productivity

## Linamar Objectives

When creating a goal in Oracle's Star Review app we are asked to select from a list of goal categories.  These goal categories are objectives in OKR.  They help ensure are goals are aligning with those chosen by the Linamar leadership.

- Financial – Investment of Choice
- Employee – Employer of Choice
- Personal - Personal and/or Team Growth
etc.
