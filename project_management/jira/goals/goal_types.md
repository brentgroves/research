# **[What are goal types?](https://support.atlassian.com/platform-experiences/docs/what-are-goal-types/)**

Goal types give organization admins the flexibility to define and structure your goals to match your organization’s preferred framework and terminology. With the type system, goals are flexible enough to work with Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), Big Hairy Audacious Goals (BHAGs), Big Rocks, or any other framework you choose.

## Understanding goal types and related concepts

Note: Goals and Success measures are the default labels. An organization admin can rename these labels, so you may see different terminology in your app.

Goal types are tightly coupled with a few other concepts related to goals that work together to help you track your progress.

## Success measures

**[Success measures](https://support.atlassian.com/platform-experiences/docs/what-are-success-measures-and-key-results/)** represent the specific, measurable outcome that contributes toward achieving the overall goal. They’re commonly known as **Key results** (used with the Objective goal type) and offer a more robust way to track specific outcomes that contribute to a goal. A single goal can have up to 20 success measures, but 3-5 are often sufficient.
