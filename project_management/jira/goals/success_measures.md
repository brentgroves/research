# **[What are success measures and key results?](https://support.atlassian.com/platform-experiences/docs/what-are-success-measures-and-key-results/)**

In Atlassian Goals app, success measure is the general term for any outcome-based metric tied to a goal. The term key result is a specific type of success measure, most often used in the **[OKR (Objectives and Key Results) framework](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr)**.

While using Goals, you might see different terms—success measure, key result, or key performance indicator (KPI)—depending on your organization’s settings or preferred framework. In practice, they all serve the same purpose: to define and track the outcomes that show progress toward your goal.

**Goals and success measures** are default labels. An organization admin can rename these labels, so you may see different terminology in your app.
