# **[How to use the OKRs template](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/templates/okrs)**

## 1. Line up your ducks

Whether you’re setting goals for your company, your department or a small team, make sure you know how **[goal setting](https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/strategic-planning/setting-goals)** works in general and how **[OKRs](https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/strategic-planning/setting-goals/okrs)** specifically can help. It’s also a good idea to review the **[OKRs play in the Atlassian Team Playbook](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/okrs)** to learn how to run a goal-setting session.

## 2. Gather your notes

To complete this step, you’ll need to meet with your team and stakeholders to determine your big objectives and the measurable results you want to see, as described in the Playbook. That’s 95% of the effort. Now it’s time to turn those ideas into commitments and get them onto a page everyone can access easily. The OKRs template provides sections for all the key information you need, from the goals and measures themselves to who owns them, current status, and more. Fill out these sections based on the notes from discussions with your team.

## 3. Take a step back

Transferring your notes into the template creates another chance for you to take a look at your goals and make sure they’re on point. Are your key results clear statements that call for distinct and measurable outcomes? Are there any other teams or stakeholders you should reach out to or get a commitment from before you publish your OKRs? Is anything unclear? Are your goals a reasonable stretch or will they stretch you too thin?

Take the time to double and triple check all these things. Your OKRs can and will likely evolve, but from the start, you’ll want to make sure you can confidently sign off on them right now

## 4. Publish and revisit

Alright, @mention everyone who needs to be in the know and publish your page. But, don’t say goodbye to it. OKRs aren’t “set ‘em and forget ‘em.” You’ll want to monitor them on a regular basis to make sure you’re on track and formerly assess your wins and challenges every quarter. Did you meet your key results? Were you dreaming too big when you set them? Or, were they such a piece of cake that you were done in the first few weeks?

Regroup with your team every so often to review and, if necessary, update your OKRs. You can do all of this in Confluence thanks to the comments, editing, and publishing functions. This is especially handy if this is your first time working with OKRs framework. Confluence is built for iteration, so go ahead and keep things moving along. Iterate on your OKRs as many times as your goals change.
