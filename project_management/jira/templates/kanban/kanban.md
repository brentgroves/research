# **[Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban)**

Kanban (the Japanese word for "visual signal") is all about helping teams visualize their work, limit work currently in progress, and maximize efficiency. Use the Kanban template to increase planning flexibility, reduce bottlenecks and promote transparency throughout the development cycle

## Track work using a simple board

Work items are represented visually on your kanban board, allowing teams to track the status of work at any time. The columns on your board represent each step in your team’s workflow, from to-do to done.

How the kanban methodology applies to software development

## Use the board to limit work in progress

Set the maximum amount of work that can exist in each status with work in progress (WIP) limits. By limiting work in progress, you can improve team focus, and better identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks.

## Continuously improve with agile reports

One of the key tenets of kanban is optimizing flow for continuous delivery. Agile reports, like the cumulative flow diagram, help ensure your team are consistently delivering maximum value back to your business.

## What is kanban?

Kanban is a popular framework used to implement **[Agile](https://www.atlassian.com/agile)** and **[DevOps](https://www.atlassian.com/devops/what-is-devops)** software development. It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually on a **[kanban board](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards)**, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.

## Optimizing software development with Kanban flow

Kanban flow, a cornerstone of agile and DevOps methodologies, drives efficiency by orchestrating seamless task progression through visualized workflows. Kanban flow mirrors the streamlined inventory management of supermarkets, ensuring tasks move through development processes precisely when needed.
