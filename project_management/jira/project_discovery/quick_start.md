## Quick start guide

Follow the steps below to kickstart your first discovery project.

## Step 1 - Create a project

Log into your Jira Product Discovery site and click on the Projects dropdown in the top navigation. Click Create project. Here you’ll find **[several templates](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/templates)** you can choose from across the Jira suite of products.

## Step 2 - Assign project roles

Decide who on your team is a Creator (create and manage ideas, views, and projects) and a Contributor (add insights, comments, and reactions, and if permitted, create ideas).

To manage project access and roles, visit Project settings in the lower lefthand navigation of your discovery project, and select Access. Note, you must be a Creator or an admin to complete this step.

## Step 3 - Add ideas

Once you’ve set up your project it’s time to add your **[ideas](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/product-discovery/guides/ideas/overview)**. A Jira Product Discovery project is made up of ideas, which can be anything from opportunities to potential solutions.

To add an idea, click the blue Create button.
