Atlassian doesn't offer one single "bundle" for Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket, but rather provides Standard, Premium, and Enterprise plans for each product individually, often with integrated features and discounts when used together, especially via the "Teamwork Collection" for Premium/Enterprise or by adding Atlassian Guard for security, allowing you to mix and match tiers for your desired features, storage, uptime, and support, with Premium offering 99.9% SLA, 24/7 support, and unlimited storage for scaling teams.
Here's a breakdown of the options:
Key Plans & Features:
Free: For small teams (up to 10 users for Jira/Confluence, 5 for Bitbucket), basic features, limited storage.
Standard: More users, storage (250GB), advanced permissions, 9/5 regional support (Jira/Confluence).
Premium: 99.9% uptime SLA, 1-hour critical support response, 24/7 support, unlimited storage, cross-team planning (Jira), Atlassian Intelligence (AI).
Enterprise: Highest security, advanced admin, cross-product analytics (Data Lake), Atlassian Guard included, 99.95% SLA.
