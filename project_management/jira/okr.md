## What are OKRs?

OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results. They’re a simple project management tool that help project managers outline and meet their goals. They typically work by prompting you to set an objective and then come up with three to five key results you’re hoping to see. The OKRs should help your team members analyze and understand what role they need to play in the project and which tasks to complete.

For example, say you’re running a project that focuses on improving overall customer satisfaction. One objective may be to improve your customer service department. Examples of key results might include:

- Bringing the average call waiting time under five minutes
- Cutting churn rate in half
- Hiring two new customer service representatives to reduce individual workload and increase productivity

- Improve Structures Project Management
  - Research and publish information relating to Project Management
  - Research and publish information relating to Goal Setting
  - Setup Information System's Team in Jira

- Improve Structures Data Analytics
  - Publish the Power BI workflow
  - Publish the Medallion Workflow
  - Setup Microsoft Fabric Org Apps

OKRs for project management describe objectives or goals you need to achieve and the path you can take to get there.

Aside from adding clarity into goal setting and how to achieve those goals, OKRs can directly contribute to a company’s success.

## Why are OKRs important in project management?

With your OKR software or template, you can clearly define long-term and short-term goals and create an action plan for how to achieve them. The benefits teams can reap from implementing OKRs include:

- Connecting employees to corporate goals
- Providing a clear direction for all team members
- Increasing productivity by focusing on specific goals and outcomes

OKRs go beyond the static process of outlining goals in Excel spreadsheets or Google Docs and then emailing them out to team members. Instead, OKRs provide a dynamic and flexible framework that makes it easy for everyone to track progress and make informed decisions based on current data.

Conversely, if objectives are not being met, OKRs make it easy to evaluate why they’re not being achieved. Then, team leaders can reallocate resources to change the strategy and work toward these goals in a different way. Many successful corporations use OKRs to their advantage, including Google, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

Setting up OKRs is a simple process once you understand the basics. To follow the OKR framework, check out the following steps.

## Setting up OKRs with project teams

Identifying common objectives for each of your projects and tasks is only the first step in implementing OKRs. Once you have a goal, you need to link that goal to targeted results, considering all possible outcomes. Then, you track and monitor progress toward the objective.

To set up OKRs:

- Ask yourself what your company goals are and which objectives will help you achieve them
- Choose the right tools to support your team and organization in achieving those objectives
- Remember to include your whole team in steps one and two
Write your OKR objective statement
- Develop your key results
- Plan your initiatives
- Regularly track where you are in achieving your initiatives
