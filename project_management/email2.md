Just started using Oracle's star review app in October and wasn't quite sure how to use it. For 2026 I decided to use **[Jira (AI-Powered Project Management)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPOWZSxEslU)** to manage the Oracle's Star review goals.

## **[OKRs: The ultimate guide to objectives and key results](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr)**

An OKR is a popular management strategy that defines objectives and tracks results. It helps create alignment and engagement around measurable goals.

Introduced and popularized in the 1970s at Intel, it has since spread throughout technology companies as a way to help employees understand and be engaged in an enterprise's charter. Studies show that team members are more engaged in their work and more productive when they have a clear idea of what the team is trying to achieve, and more importantly, the significance of the task.

For example, say you’re running a project that focuses on improving overall customer satisfaction. One objective may be to improve your customer service department. Examples of key results might include:

- Bringing the average call waiting time under five minutes
- Cutting churn rate in half
- Hiring two new customer service representatives to reduce individual workload and increase productivity

## Linamars Objectives

- Financial – Investment of Choice
- Employee – Employer of Choice
- Personal - Personal and/or Team Growth
- Customer – Supplier of Choice

## Examples of key results

“Key results” are the desired outcome after taking a set of actions. A common mistake with OKRs is confusing desired outcomes with actions used to reach objectives. For example, in the case below, the objective is to reduce the number of data errors in the system. But the specified key result is the installation of a new vendor package release. However, there’s **no mention of tracked data errors** or the future goal. There’s no way of knowing if installing the latest release made things better, worse, or had no effect.

- **What NOT to do:** Mistake the actions taken to achieve an objective as the key result. For example:
- **Objectives:** Reduce the number of data errors in the system
- **Key results:** Installation of release 10.0 of the vendor package

- **What NOT to do:** Align key result with a corporate objective.

- **Objectives:** Customer – Supplier of Choice
- **Key results:** Automate data collection for JT Fronts to give our customer a high confidence in our ability to perform.
