## What is mission vs. vision?

Without a clear mission or vision, your company will be defined by chance.

On the other hand, simply having a mission and vision statement won’t guarantee business success. The question of “where you’re going” (vision) and “how you’ll get there” (mission) will ensure you’re on the right path with your strategy.

The success of your mission and vision working together depends on how you communicate it, align your organization to it, then inform your goals and objectives with it.

In this article, we’ll explore:

- What mission and vision statements are
- Similarities and differences between mission vs. vision
- The importance of mission and vision to your strategy
- Mission and vision statement examples

## Mission and vision statements, defined

Mission statements define the concrete business objectives of an organization and how they will be reached, while a vision statement explains an organization's ultimate future aspirations.

## Mission statement

Your mission statement is your purpose, declared, defining exactly what your company is doing now. It’s an embodiment of what you stand for, who you’re doing it for, and how you’re accomplishing it.

Mission statements shouldn’t exist in some arbitrary Word document or company webpage nobody will ever see. Your mission statement is the wheel of your ship, and without it, you’re floating aimlessly in the ocean of your business.

## Vision statement

If a mission statement is about where you’re presently going, your company's vision statement is like looking into a fortune teller’s crystal ball. A vision statement focuses on describing your company's desired future state, even more bold and high-reaching than the mission statement, highlighting the grand value or change you hope to drive in the world.

A well-crafted vision statement is something your teams can rally around — it invokes the passion, curiosity, and innovation all great companies are known for. It should also encompass your company's core values.
