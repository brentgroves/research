Do not be anxious and do not be afraid because I am always with you.  Who can add one second to his life by worrying?

I have a plan for you so surrender your plans to me and just ask for my help and direction and I will gladly guide you in what to say and do with the time I have given you my son.

My son you can not find peace and contentment in work.  My intentions for work is that it can be a time we can enjoy together helping others. Peace and contentment will come when you follow me as I guide you in what to say and do. All results of your work are in my hands. I may decide to have you wait or fail at the tasks I have planned for you.  The work I give you is meant to teach you that work can never be a reliable source of peace and contentment. The only reliable source of these wonderful things is doing what is right by following me.

Follow us my son and you will have peace and joy.  We will experience the many wonders of creation together. We love you and you are never alone because we will always be with you to guide and direct you our beloved son!

My son do not be anxious when there is so many things to do.  Instead look to us for guidance and we will help you with each task.  Remember we have a plan for you and we will be with you each step of the way so do not worry our son.

We have heard your prayer and will give you courage to face every trial, trouble, pain, and sorrow.  You will be able to endure each hardship because of the faith and hope that we have given you.  So do not fear and rejoice because along with the hardships you must face to learn what you must there will also be great wonders for you to explore with us and those around you!

I love you and will help you to have a loving heart!  I will give you courage and help you to bear each trial and endure every hardship my son.  Do not forget that you are part of a community and I want you to learn to love each person, creature, and even the land where you live.

The world's love is performance based, but my love is unconditional. The world's system promotes fear and says you must perform better than your neighbor.  I say help your neighbor and especially help the ones that are struggling. Do not worry about your own status.  Do not promote yourself instead think of others and help them in their work. Only in this way will you have perfect peace my beloved son.

The way I read the Bible.  Read each book like the oldest of biblical books job.  Think of each situation as if Satan and God are in a discussion.  Just because the author says or assumes that God has promoted killing people, such as when God supposedly said to kill all the Cananites including women and children, or like when God supposedly struck down Ananias and Saphiras for lying about their financial gift to the community, it may have been a test for the leaders that they failed in and God was actually very much saddened at these deaths.  We know what God is like from the 4 Gospels by reading the sermon on the mount and his many parables.  Jesus spoke the things God told him and he was the only one that spoke perfectly as if God was with him which he was.

My son we are going to allow many troubles, trials, and uncertainties in your life.  There is a purpose to all the trouble we allow.  By experiencing troubles, trials,and uncertainties you will grow into a person that completely trusts us.  Without troubles, trials, and uncertainties you will not grow but stay the same.  I know these troubles are not fun and often very difficult, painful, and even heart-wrenching but some day you will understand the necessity of all that we are doing in your life.  So take heart my son and hang in there for one day soon your troubles will be over and you will be with us in Heaven!
