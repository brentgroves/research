## Introduction to The Daily Scrum

To keep work moving smoothly, the Developers get together for 15 minutes every day to focus on the Sprint Goal and to plan the upcoming day’s work. During the Daily Scrum, they identify any issues they need help in resolving, ask for help when they need it and adjust the Sprint Backlog, if necessary.

The Daily Scrum ensures that all team members are aligned, aware of any updates or changes and that the team is making progress toward the Sprint Goal. A Daily Scrum also promotes quick decision making and may reduce the need to create additional, impromptu meetings.

## Daily Scrum at a Glance

| Event       | Inspection                  | Adaptation     | Participants | Timebox     |

| Daily Scrum | Progress toward Sprint Goal | Sprint Backlog | Developers   | 15 minutes  |

It should be noted that the name of this event is not the Daily Stand-Up or Daily Huddle. Older versions of the Scrum Guide referred to this meeting as the “Daily Stand-up.” However, it was changed to recognize that participants are not required to stand and in fact, some participants may not be able to stand during the meeting.
