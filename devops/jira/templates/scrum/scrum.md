## What is a scrum template?

The scrum template is pre-formatted to help teams organize and plan their work within the Scrum framework. Scrum is one of the most popular frameworks for implementing agile. With scrum, the product is built in a series of fixed-length iterations called sprints that give teams a framework for shipping on a regular cadence.

## Boards

**[Scrum boards](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/scrum-board)** help agile teams break large, complex projects into manageable pieces of work so focused teams, working in sprints, ship faster.

## **[How to get started with the scrum template](https://www.youtube.com/embed/SOVGEsV5O9A)**

This template uses Jira to help accelerate your team across sprints.

## 1. Choose your project type

You can decide whether you want your scrum projects to be managed by your team (team-managed projects) or centrally by an admin (company-managed projects).

- **Team-managed projects** are ideal for autonomous teams who want to get going quickly and control their own projects and workflow. They can be set up and maintained by anyone.

- **Company-managed projects** are the best choice if you want to standardize configuration across multiple Jira projects in your organization. These are set up and maintained by a centralized admin.

## Build a backlog

Before a sprint can start, you will need to populate your **[backlog](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/backlogs)** with all the work your team needs to do. The items in your backlog (which might be user stories, design changes, bugs, etc.) will become the building blocks for the features or products you are starting to build in your board and timeline.
