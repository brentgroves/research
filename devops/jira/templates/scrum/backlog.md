# **[Product backlog: Tips for creation and prioritization](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/backlogs)**

A healthy product backlog is much like a healthy human: groomed, organized, and living in the open.

## Key Takeaways

- A product backlog is a prioritized list of work derived from the roadmap, guiding development teams on what to deliver next.
- Well managed backlogs improve prioritization, efficiency, communication, and customer satisfaction.
- Backlogs should be regularly reviewed, refined, and aligned with stakeholder feedback and business objectives.
- Maintain and prioritize your product backlog to ensure your team focuses on the most valuable and impactful work.

A well-prioritized agile backlog not only makes release and iteration planning easier, it broadcasts all the things your team intends to spend time on—including internal work that the customer will never notice.

This helps set expectations with stakeholders and other teams, especially when they bring additional work to you, and makes engineering time a fixed asset.
