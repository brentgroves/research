## What is an idea in Jira Product Discovery?

Every great feature or product starts as an idea that needs to be validated, tested, and shaped. In Jira Product Discovery, ideas are a type of issue, like epics and tasks. Ideas can be problems, opportunities, potential solutions, or feature requests. They capture the myriad of suggestions and feedback product teams receive from around the business, from customers, or from their own research.

## What is the anatomy of an idea?

In order to prioritize ideas, you need supporting information and context. Ideas have descriptions, comments, fields, insights and delivery tickets to capture information and traits.

Note that fields in a product discovery project are unique to Jira Product Discovery, and do not impact any other Jira project.

- **Description** - Information about your idea like hypotheses, validation methods, and more. You can also use a description template to standardize the information collected in this section.
- **Tabs** - Tabs contain information specific to this individual idea, including comments, insights, linked delivery tickets from Jira Software, and history of edits and changes associated with the idea
- **Pinned Fields** - Users can customize this section and pin fields that are most important to them or their team here.
- **Fields in this view** - Fields that appear in this section are specific to the view that you’re in. You may have a leadership view or a prioritization view, each with different fields relevant for that audience.
- **Other fields** - Fields hidden in the “Other fields” expand show all other fields that are being used in the entire project, but aren’t present in the view that you’re in. You can choose to pin views from this section if they are important.

- **Hypothesis testing** - define your hypothesis, how you’ll validate it, and capture key decisions
- **Problem definition** - define the problem space, target audience, and validation method
- **Solution definition** - define potential solutions and how you’ll validate each one
- **Solution retrospective** - conduct a retrospective on the exploration of solutions and their outcomes

## How do I manage ideas?

When you have a large list of ideas to manage or are triaging ideas that have been submitted, you need to be able to merge similar or duplicate ideas, or do away with ideas you won’t commit to. In a discovery project, you can clone, merge, and archive ideas.

## Clone ideas

If you need to duplicate an idea to replicate fields or a description, you can clone ideas within a project. To clone an idea, click into the full view of any idea, and click Clone in the upper right hand corner.

## Merge ideas

When internal teams or customers submit ideas, you may find similar or identical ideas in a project that you can merge together. To merge one or multiple ideas, click into the full view of any idea and click Merge in the upper right hand corner. Select the target idea you want to merge into, and the details you want to move over, like insights, attachments, and linked delivery issues.
