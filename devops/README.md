# DevOps

DevOps is a cultural philosophy, set of practices, and tools that combine software Development and IT Operations to automate and integrate processes, breaking down silos for faster, more reliable software delivery, focusing on collaboration, continuous integration (CI/CD), automation, and feedback loops across the entire software lifecycle. It enables teams to build, test, and release software more frequently, improving quality, speed, and efficiency to better meet customer needs.
