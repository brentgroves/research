## Why MicroStack?

Install OpenStack anywhere in a few simple steps and let Kubernetes operators manage it for you. MicroStack (based on Sunbeam) is not yet another OpenStack on Kubernetes. It is a canonical OpenStack with native Kubernetes experience.

## Lucid interface

MicroStack is the most straightforward OpenStack ever. It installs in minutes through a friendly interface, making OpenStack fully accessible to those with no previous experience. Just give it a try and see whether OpenStack is suitable for you.

## K8s-native architecture

MicroStack comes with a K8s-native architecture. This includes OCI images for OpenStack control plane services wrapped with Kubernetes operators for streamlined lifecycle management.

## Minimal footprint

MicroStack is optimised for a minimal footprint. Its resource requirements are lower than for vanilla OpenStack. All of that makes MicroStack suitable for devices with limited hardware resources, including workstations and edge infrastructure.

## Sensible defaults

MicroStack includes stable OpenStack services only, and the major compute, network and storage options. This eliminates friction, abstracts OpenStack's complexity and provides an “on rails” experience.
