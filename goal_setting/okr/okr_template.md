# OKR Template

OKRs are made up of two components:  

- **Objective:** what you’re trying to accomplish
- **Key results:** how you’ll measure whether you achieve the objective

```yaml
objectives:
  linamar: Customer – Supplier of Choice
  structures: Automate JT Fronts performance index calculation process.
key_result:
```

## Key Result format

We will `objective` as measured by `these key results`.
