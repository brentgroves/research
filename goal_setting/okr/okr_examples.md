## An overview of OKRs

OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) are a framework used by teams and organizations to set challenging, ambitious, collaborative goals with measurable results. An OKR framework helps you track progress, create alignment, and encourage engagement around measurable goals.  

OKRs are a public way of establishing what the team is going to work on and who will be accountable for the success or **[failure of the strategy](https://quantive.com/resources/articles/strategy-failure)**.

At the company level, OKRs act as a north star for your organization and are goals that count on efforts from every level of the business.

Setting company OKRs allows individual teams to set goals that help drive those overarching objectives while preserving their autonomy and enabling their own development and growth.

## Breaking down OKRs

OKRs are made up of two components:  

- **Objective:** what you’re trying to accomplish
- **Key results:** how you’ll measure whether you achieve the objective

**[When writing OKRs](https://quantive.com/resources/articles/how-to-write-okrs)**, use this format:

**Objectives** need to be clear, inspiring, and easy to rally around. The golden rule of writing objectives is that any reasonable person should be able to understand the objective’s aim and motivation at a glance.

When looking at objective and key results examples, try to imagine ways to make the statements less generic and more inspiring.

Your objective is a strategic theme, a qualitative statement of what is to be achieved. An objective should be significant, concrete, and action-oriented, designed to propel the organization in the desired direction.

A **key result (KR)** is measurable and verifiable; there’s always a definitive answer to whether it’s achieved. Setting around three KRs for an objective is a reasonable place to start, and you’ll want a specific person to be accountable for its success.  

For objective and key results examples, ensure the goals are both quantitative and ambitious.

## Company OKR examples

Adopting a company OKR strategy helps keep three perspectives in mind — mission, vision, and business system integration. The objective should be aspirational (derived from the **[mission and vision](https://quantive.com/resources/articles/mission-vs-vision)**, while the key results should be attainable with respect to department and team OKRs.
